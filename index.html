    <h2>🧑‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Ivy 👋</p>
    <p>I created this website as part of a class project for my Digital Communication course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I’m just starting to explore the world of web design, and this is my very first try at putting together a personal page using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>I’ve always enjoyed learning new things, especially when it comes to using digital tools to make life a little more organized and creative. I like experimenting with design, managing content and discovering ways to work smarter online.</p>
    <p>Some of my favourite things to do? I love planning trips, trying out new productivity apps, and occasionally helping friends with their online shops and social media. Spreadsheets might seem dull to some, but I enjoy using them to plan and manage my finances.</p>
    <p>This website is just a small step in my journey, but I’m excited to keep learning and growing in the digital space.</p>
