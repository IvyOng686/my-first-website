    <h2>🧑‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Ivy 👋</p>
    <p> I am a lifelong learner with a love for planning, exploring and creating. I find joy in the details — whether it's mapping out a travel itinerary, building a budget that works or diving into new digital tools just to see what they can do.</p>
    <p> Travel inspires me, but it’s the process behind it that I truly enjoy — the research, the planning and the satisfaction of organizing a journey from dream to destination. I'm equally passionate about financial wellness and believe that good budgeting isn’t about restriction — it’s about freedom and clarity.</p>
    <p> I’m also drawn to the world of eCommerce and digital learning. From exploring how online stores operate to picking up new design and communication skills, I love discovering ways to grow both creatively and practically.</p>
    <p> This space is where I share pieces of what I’m learning and loving.</p>
